20. Valid Parentheses
Check if a string of brackets is valid using a stack to match pairs.

## Min Stack
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

### Explanation ( Theory )
A min stack is a special type of stack that keeps track of the minimum element at all times by using an auxiliary stack to store the minimum values.    
This allows for O(1) time complexity for retrieving the minimum element, while still supporting standard stack operations.
